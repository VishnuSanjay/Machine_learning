    "### Node selection and expansion\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Analyze this\" assignment\n",
    "\n",
    "UCB-1 is a weak bound as it relies on a very general bounds (Hoeffding Inequality, to be exact). \n",
    "* Try playing with alpha. The theoretically optimal alpha for CartPole is 200 (max reward). \n",
    "* Use using a different exploration strategy (bayesian UCB, for example)\n",
    "* Expand not all but several random actions per `expand` call. See __the notes below__ for details.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is to find out what gives the optimal performance for `CartPole-v0` for different time budgets (i.e. different n_iter in plan_mcts.\n",

    "### Atari-RAM\n",

    "\"Build this\" assignment\n",
    "\n",
    "Apply MCTS to play atari games. In particular, let's start with ```gym.make(\"MsPacman-ramDeterministic-v0\")```.\n",

    "\n",
    " * Atari has a special interface for snapshots:\n",
    "   ```   \n",
    "   snapshot = self.env.ale.cloneState()\n",
    "   ...\n",
    "   self.env.ale.restoreState(snapshot)\n",

    " \n",
    "* Run MCTS on the game above. \n",
    " * Start with small tree size to speed-up computations\n",
    " * You will probably want to rollout for 10-100 steps (t_max) for starters\n",
    " * Consider using discounted rewards (see __notes at the end__)\n",

    "### Integrate learning into planning\n",
    "\n",
    "Planning on each iteration is a costly thing to do. You can speed things up drastically if you train a classifier to predict which action will turn out to be best according to MCTS.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do so, just record which action did the MCTS agent take on each step and fit something to [state, mcts_optimal_action]\n",
    "* You can also use optimal actions from discarded states to get more (dirty) samples. Just don't forget to fine-tune without them.\n",
    "* It's also worth a try to use P(best_action|state) from your model to select best nodes in addition to UCB\n",
    "* If your model is lightweight enough, try using it as a rollout policy.\n",
    "\n",
    "While CartPole is glorious enough, try expanding this to ```gym.make(\"MsPacmanDeterministic-v0\")```\n",

    "\n",
    "You will need to implement a special layer that performs value iteration-like update to a recurrent memory. This can be implemented the same way you did attention from week7 or week8."

    "## Notes\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Assumptions\n",
    "\n",
    "The full list of assumptions is\n",
    "* __Finite actions__ - we enumerate all actions in `expand`\n",
    "* __Episodic (finite) MDP__ - while technically it works for infinite mdp, we rollout for $ 10^4$ steps. If you are knowingly infinite, please adjust `t_max` to something more reasonable.\n",
    "* __No discounted rewards__ - we assume $\\gamma=1$. If that isn't the case, you only need to change a two lines in `rollout` and use `my_R = r + gamma*child_R` for `propagate`\n",
    "* __pickleable env__ - won't work if e.g. your env is connected to a web-browser surfing the internet. For custom envs, you may need to modify get_snapshot/load_snapshot from `WithSnapshots`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### On `get_best_leaf` and `expand` functions\n",
    "\n",
    "This MCTS implementation only selects leaf nodes for expansion.\n",
    "This doesn't break things down because `expand` adds all possible actions. Hence, all non-leaf nodes are by design fully expanded and shouldn't be selected.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to only add a few random action on each expand, you will also have to modify `get_best_leaf` to consider returning non-leafs.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Rollout policy\n",
    "\n",
    "We use a simple uniform policy for rollouts. This introduces a negative bias to good situations that can be messed up completely with random bad action. As a simple example, if you tend to rollout with uniform policy, you better don't use sharp knives and walk near cliffs.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can improve that by integrating a reinforcement _learning_ algorithm with a computationally light agent. You can even train this agent on optimal policy found by the tree search.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Contributions\n",
    "* Reusing some code from 5vision [solution for deephack.RL](https://github.com/5vision/uct_atari), code by Mikhail Pavlov\n",
