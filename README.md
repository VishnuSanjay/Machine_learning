# Machine_learning
A repository of machine learning code I've written in online courseware


The **Machine_learning_CourseraCS229** folder contains all files I used in Andrew Ng's coursera version of CS229. The programming language in use is MATLAB.

The **DL_specialization** folder refers to a coursera specialization by the same name, also taught by Andrew Ng. Python is used here, with neural nets being coded up using numpy, tensorflow and later keras (progressively higher level frameworks)

The **AML** folder refers to another Coursera specialization that I am currently exploring. For now, only my code from part 4, **practical reinforcement learning** is on Gitub.

If you are currently enrolled in any of these courses, or plan to take them in the future, **DO NOT** look for the code. It will significantly reduce the amount of learning you get to and will be motivated to do.

To add in the future:
* Work from the other AML courses
* Work from fastai
* Work from Geoff Hinton's course
* Future work I plan to do in RL. Sights currently on implementations from the Berkeley Deep RL and David Silver RL courses, as well as my own implementations from Sutton's text (just started)
